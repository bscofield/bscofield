Where to find me online. 

- [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@bscofield) and [Bluesky](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/benscofield.com), as increasingly-necessary escape hatches
- [My calendar](https://tidycal.com/bscofield/30), if you'd like to grab some time to chat
- [Rands Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)
- too many random Discords and other Slacks
- Facebook, mostly for family
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bscofield/), reluctantly

I'm @bscofield pretty much everywhere, and I try to keep the same dog-on-head avatar as well.
