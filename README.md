Where to find me online. 

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bscofield), for now
- [Rands Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)
- too many random Discords and other Slacks
- Facebook, mostly for family
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bscofield/), reluctantly
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@bscofield), as an escape hatch

I'm @bscofield pretty much everywhere, and I try to keep the same dog-on-head avatar as well.
